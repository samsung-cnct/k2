## Options
### Root Options

| Key Name | Required     | Type   | Description|
| -------- | ------------ | ------ | --- |
| name     | __Required__ | String | Configuration name |
| runtime  | __Required__ | String | Name of container runtime. At this time only docker is supported |
| type     | __Required__ | String | Type of docker installation. If not specified distro is assumed. |
| url      | Depends      | String | If type is not distro, URL where the installation medium can be found |

Type may be one of [distro, tgz]. If type is distro then the distribution provided installation of docker will be used. If type is tgz then url must be a valid url pointing to a gzipped tarball containing a single directory. The contents of the directory must include all binaries needed to install the container runtime. __These binaries will be placed in /opt/cnct/bin__ and systemd drop-ins will be generated to start the container runtime.
